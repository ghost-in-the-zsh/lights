    # clashes between fields that are manually defined and those that are
    # inferred[1].

    # The model's private `_date_created` field must be treated as the
    # `_is_powered_on` field above for the same reasons.
    #
    # The `dump_only` option effectively marks this field as "read-only"
    # and cannot be set during de-serialization... because naming the
    # parameter `read_only` would've been too obvious.
    #
    # `DateTime` objects are stored in the database in naive form, i.e. they
    # are timezone-unaware without UTC offsets (i.e. `Â±HH:MM`). Because of
    # this, the `%z` part of the "%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S%z" `format` is an empty
    # string, and gets serialized as such in its ISO-8601 format[1].
    #
    # This can cause problems for clients because `datetime` objects are
    # assumed to be in the *local* TZ unless otherwise specified. Since there's
    # no format string that will add the TZ info and we know they get stored in
    # UTC, we hard-code a `+HH:MM` offset of `+00:00` to add TZ information
    # until a better method is found. The serialized format is the same as that
    # from `.isoformat(timespec='seconds')`[1] and this is what clients should
    # use.
